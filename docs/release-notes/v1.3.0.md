# Release Notes — v1.3.0 (2026-01-16)

## Highlights
- Settings Window: standalone macOS settings window with liquid glass UI.
- Status Bar Display Modes: choose None, Temperature, Power Usage (Watts) or Fan Speed %.
- Stability fixes: SMC parsing validation to prevent crashes and layout errors.

## Added
- Settings Window: New comprehensive settings panel accessible from the menu bar popover.
- Status Bar Display Modes: Choice of what to show in the menu bar (None, Temperature, Power Usage, Fan Speed %).
- High Temperature Alerts: Configurable threshold with system notifications.
- Auto Mode Switching: Automatically switch to automatic control when temperatures exceed threshold.
- Monitoring Interval Control: Adjustable refresh rate for temperature monitoring (0.5–5.0 seconds).
- Launch at Login Toggle: Enable/disable launch at login from settings UI.

## Fixed
- Status bar display crash: Fixed crash caused by invalid SMC data parsing ("Negative value is not representable"). Added validation to SMC reads.
- Power Usage display: Now shows battery power in Watts (`W`) when available; falls back to fan speed percentage when not.
- StatusBarManager: Rewrote to properly render dynamic text and animation; fixed issues where Power Usage display wasn't updating.

## Improved
- Status bar compactness: Shortened and compacted menu bar text, added compact font and image-only option for minimal footprint.
- Robustness: Improved SMC parsing and added defensive checks to prevent crashes and layout errors.

## Notes
- This release moves the `v1.3.0` tag to the latest change and updates the landing page documentation.
- If you installed via the one-line script, re-run it to get the latest fixes once a new binary is published.
